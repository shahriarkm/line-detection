# Lane Detection with OpenCV

## Overview
This code is an implementation of a lane detection algorithm using OpenCV and Python. It processes video frames from a dashcam or similar source and detects lane lines on the road. The algorithm segments the lane lines and calculates the radius of curvature of the lane. It then overlays the detected lane lines and curvature information on the video frames.

## Code Description

### Importing Libraries
The code begins by importing necessary libraries, which include OpenCV (`cv2`) and NumPy (`numpy`). Additionally, there are some custom functions imported from a module called `manip_functions` (which is assumed to contain functions such as `warp`, `abs_sobel_thresh`, `fit_polynomial`, and `measure_curvature_pixels`).

### Lane Detection Functions

#### `find_lane_pixels(binary_warped)`
This function detects lane pixels in a binary warped image. It uses a sliding window approach to find the lane pixels' positions and separates them into left and right lanes. The function returns the pixel coordinates of the left and right lanes and an output image with visualizations.

#### `fit_polynomial(binary_warped)`
This function calls `find_lane_pixels` to get the lane pixels and then fits a second-degree polynomial to these pixels to define the lane lines. It also draws the detected lanes on the output image.

#### `warp(img, warp=True)`
This function is responsible for warping or unwarping an image based on the `warp` argument. It uses perspective transformation to convert the view of the road to a bird's-eye view, which makes lane detection easier.

#### Gradient and Color Thresholding Functions
There are functions like `abs_sobel_thresh`, `mag_thresh`, and `dir_threshold` that perform gradient and color thresholding. These functions are used to identify lane lines by highlighting gradients in the image.

### Lane Curvature Calculation
The code includes a `measure_curvature_pixels` function that calculates the radius of curvature of the lanes based on the fitted polynomials.

### Video Processing
The code processes video frames captured from a source (e.g., a dashcam video). It resizes the frames and applies a series of image processing steps, including thresholding for gradient and color information. Then, it detects lane lines, calculates the lane curvature, and overlays this information on the original video frames. The result is displayed in a window.

### User Interaction
The code allows user interaction by pressing the 'q' key to exit the video playback and the 'e' key to continue playing the video after a pause.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have OpenCV and NumPy installed.
2. Prepare a video file (e.g., `project_video.mp4`) with road footage.
3. Place the video file in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the script, and it will process the video frames and display the results.

This code can serve as a foundation for building more advanced lane detection and lane-keeping systems. It may need further parameter tuning to work effectively on different road and lighting conditions.

Remember that this code assumes the existence of a module `manip_functions` with the required functions. You should ensure that this module contains the necessary functions for the code to work correctly.
